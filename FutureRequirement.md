replace the send button with a cancel button while the bot message is generating and when user click that cancel button then the message streaming should be cancelled . 

Create smooth scrolling while the message is generating or not. Also create an icon to move to bottom/latest message when user scrolls up for few lines or at top.

The unordered list , list items of responses are touching the leftmost part of message container , there should be few padding for a good UX


Handle the uploading of image and image preview, currently it is taking whole screen . 

When the previous/older message of user is edited or changed then remove the next responses and generate a new response for edited message(only if message is edited and changed)
